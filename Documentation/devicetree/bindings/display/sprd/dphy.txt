Spreadtrum MIPI DSI-PHY (D-PHY)
============================================================================

Required properties:
  - compatible: value should be "sprd,dsi-phy".
  - reg: must be the dsi controller base address.
  - #address-cells, #size-cells: should be set respectively to <1> and <0>
  - sprd,ip: the IP version of the D-PHY PLL module.
  - sprd,soc: the SoC family that contains this D-PHY hardware.

Video interfaces:
  Device node can contain video interface port nodes according to [1].
  The following are properties specific to those nodes:

  port node inbound:
    - reg: (required) must be 0.
  port node outbound:
    - reg: (required) must be 1.

  endpoint node connected from DSI controller node (reg = 0):
    - remote-endpoint: specifies the endpoint in DSI node.
  endpoint node connected to panel node (reg = 1):
    - remote-endpoint: specifies the endpoint in panel node.

Example:

	dphy: dphy {
		compatible = "sprd,dsi-phy";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x0 0x63100000 0x0 0x1000>;
		status = "disabled";

		sprd,ip = "sprd,megacores-sharkle";
		sprd,soc = "sharkl3";

		/* input port*/
		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			dphy_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&dsi_out>;
			};
		};

		/* output port */
		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			dphy_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&panel_in>;
			};
		};
	};
