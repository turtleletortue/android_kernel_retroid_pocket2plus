Dummy Connector for Spreadtrum SoC
============================================================================

The dummy connector is just used for engineer debug before realy chip bring-up.
The dummy connector provides a display timing for drm driver. And it provides
a dummy encoder for crtc. This connector can be connected to either a realy
crtc(DPU) or a dummy crtc. It is useful for HAPS/ZEBU platform development.
Note that the dummy crtc should not be used for product.

Required properties:
  - compatible: value should be "sprd,dummy-connector";
  - display-timings: containing video timings [1];
  - port: a port node with endpoint definitions as defined in document [2].

Example:

SoC specific DT entry:

	dummy-connector {
		compatible = "sprd,dummy-connector";

		display-timings {
			timing0 {
			clock-frequency = <58950000>;
				hactive = <720>;
				vactive = <1280>;
				hback-porch = <10>;
				hfront-porch = <10>;
				vback-porch = <10>;
				vfront-porch = <10>;
				hsync-len = <10>;
				vsync-len = <10>;
			};
		};

		port {
			dummy_connector_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&dummy_crtc_out>;
			};
		};
	};


Board specific DT entry (if it has dsi & dphy node):

	&dsi {
		status = "disabled";
	};

	&dphy {
		status = "disabled";
	};
