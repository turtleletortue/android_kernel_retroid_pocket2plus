Spreadtrum dmc driver interface
This binding follows the generic dmc bindings defined in sprd,dmc.txt.

Required properties:
- compatible: Maybe "sprd,sharkl5-dmc","sprd,roc1-dmc" or "sprd,sharkl3-dmc".
- reg: Address range of ddr mode registers and pub monitor registers.

Example:
dmc_controller  {
	compatible = "sprd,sharkl5-dmc";
	reg = <0x0 0x31056200 0x0 0x1000>,
		<0x0 0x3000 0x0 0x1000>;
};
