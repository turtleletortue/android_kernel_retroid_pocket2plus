* Spreadtrum Nand Host Controller

The Spreadtrum Nand Host Controller provides an interface for Nand.
This file documents differences between the coreproperties described by Nand.txt
and the properties used by the Spreadtrum Nand driver.

Required properties:
- compatible:
 should be "sprd,orca-nandc"
 in order to compatible with Nand controller version
- reg: Registers location and length
- interrupts: exactly one interrupt specifier
- sprd,random-mode: if set, nandc will enable randomizer on IO data trans;
- clocks: Freq of source clk of nand controller ECC and ahb enable or disable
Example:

nandc: nand-controller@21300000 {
	compatible = "sprd,orca-nandc";
	reg = reg = <0 0x21300000 0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 59 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	sprd,random-mode;
	clock-names = "nandc_clk","nandc_ecc_clk","nandc_parent_sdr",
		"nandc_parent_ddr","nandc_ahb_enable","nandc_ecc_enable",
		"nandc_26m_enable","nandc_1x_enable","nandc_2x_enable";
	clocks = <&aon_clk CLK_NANDC_2X>,
		 <&ap_clk CLK_NANDC_ECC>,
		 <&g3_pll CLK_TWPLL_219M4>,
		 <&g3_pll CLK_TWPLL_307M2>,
		 <&apahb_gate CLK_NANDC_EB>,
		 <&apahb_gate CLK_NANDC_ECC_EB>,
		 <&apahb_gate CLK_NANDC_26M_EB>,
		 <&aonapb_gate CLK_NANDC_1X_EN>,
		 <&aonapb_gate CLK_NANDC_2X_EN>;
	status = "disabled";
};
