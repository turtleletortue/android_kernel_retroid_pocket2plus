= Spreadtrum thermal device tree bindings =

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "sprd,sharkl3-thermal"
- reg : Address range of the thermal registers
- clock-names: "enable" for thermal module enable clock.
- clocks: Should contain a clock specifier for each entry in clock-names.
- nvmem-cells: A phandle to the calibration data provided by a nvmem device.
- nvmem-cell-names: Should be "cthm_sign_cal" and "cthm_ratio_cal", "thm_delta_cal".

Example:

cpu_thm: cpu-thm@40390000 {
	compatible = "sprd,sharkl3-thermal";
	reg = <0x40390000 0x10000>;
	clock-names = "enable";
	clocks = <&aonapb_gate CLK_THM_EB>;
	#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
	nvmem-cells = <&cthm_sign>, <&cthm_ratio>, <&cthm_delta>;
	nvmem-cell-names = "thm_sign_cal", "thm_ratio_cal", "thm_delta_cal";
};
