= Spreadtrum normal eFuse device tree bindings =

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following.
	"sprd,sharkl5-cache-efuse"
- reg: Base address of efuse storage in efuse cache scheme

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of eFuse, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	cache_efuse: efuse@15c00 {
		compatible = "sprd,sharkl5-cache-efuse";
		reg = <0 0x15c00 0 0x3ff>;

		/* Data cells */
		thermal_calib: calib@10 {
			reg = <0x10 0x2>;
		};
	};

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

Example:

	thermal {
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&thermal_calib>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "calibration";
	};
