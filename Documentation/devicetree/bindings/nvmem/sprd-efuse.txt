= Spreadtrum normal eFuse device tree bindings =

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following.
	"sprd,sharkl5-efuse"
- reg: Specify the address offset of efuse controller.
- clocks: Reference to a phandle of a clock provider node.
- hwlocks: Reference to a phandle of a hwlock provider node.

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of eFuse, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	nefuse: efuse@40240000 {
		compatible = "sprd,sharkl5_efuse";
		reg = <0 0x40240000 0 0x10000>;
		clock-names = "enable";
		clocks = <&clk_aon_apb_gates0 13>;
		hwlocks = <&hwslock1 8>;

		/* Data cells */
		thermal_calib: calib@10 {
			reg = <0x10 0x2>;
		};
	};

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

Example:

	thermal {
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&thermal_calib>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "calibration";
	};
