Binding for cpudvfs device regulator
Create a virtual i2c device to adjust the cpu's voltage via an i2c channel

Required properties:
	- compatible: define the compatible property for the i2c device to
	 	      match the specific i2c driver.
	- reg: i2c address
	- dvfs-dcdc-i2c: which dcdc is connected to this i2c.

Example-1:
	cpudvfs@61{
		compatible = "sprd,cpudvfs-regulator-sharkl5";
		reg = <0x61>;
		dvfs-dcdc-i2c = <1>;
	};
